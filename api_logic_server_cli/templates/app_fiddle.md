# App Fiddle

<summary>Welcome to the Flask/SQLAlchemy ‚ÄúApp Fiddle‚Äù</summary>

Use this ***Application Fiddle*** to learn Flask/SQLAlchemy in Codespaces.  You have 3 running apps - execute them, explore the code, alter them (e.g., create endpoints, issue queries), use the debugger, etc.

The Key Technology Concepts (at end) is an inventory of essential skills for creating Flask/SQLAlchemy systems.  Each are illustrated here.

These projects all use the [Northwind Sample Database](https://valhuber.github.io/ApiLogicServer/Sample-Database/).  Other databases are also provided in Next Steps.

Start with the first application - a Basic Flask/SQLAlchemy App.

Then, discover **API Logic Server** - an Open Source CLI to create executable projects, **instantly,** with a single command.  Its open source, and **open** technology: customize projects in your IDE, including unique spreadsheet like rules for logic and security - 40X more concise than manual code.

<summary>1. Basic App: Flask / SQLAlchemy -- flexible, but slow</summary>

This illustrates a typical framework-based approach for creating projects - a minimal project for seeing core Flask and SQLAlchemy services in action.

Frameworks are flexible, and leverage your existing dev environment (IDE, git, etc).  But the manual effort is time-consuming, and complex.  This minimal project does not provide:

* an API endpoint for each table

* a User Interface

* any security, or business logic (multi-table derivations and constraints).

Execute using the Run Configuration, and test with `cURL`.  The relevant code is `api/end_points.py`.

<details markdown>

<summary> Show me how </summary>

&nbsp;

To run the basic app:

1. Click Run Configurations, and the green button to start the server

2. Copy the `cURL` text, and paste it into the `bash`/`zsh` window

<summary>2. API Logic Project: Instant, Open</summary>

&nbsp;

Instead of frameworks, we might employ a Low Code approach.  Low Code tools provide excellent custom user interfaces.  However, these often require extensive screen painting, and typically require a proprietary IDE.

The *API Logic Project No Customization* app provides an alternative, creating an entire project by reading your schema.  This approach is:

* **Instant:** faster than Low Code screen painting, with instant APIs and Admin User Interfaces:

  * **API:** an endpoint for each table, with filtering, sorting, pagination and related data access.  Swagger is automatic.

  * **Admin UI:** multi-page / multi-table apps, with page navigations, automatic joins and declarative hide/show.  It executes a yaml file, so basic customizations do not require HTML or JavaScript background.

      * Custom UIs can be built using your tool of choice (React, Angular, etc), using the API

* **Open:** a fully open approach:

  * **Open Source:** install with pip or docker

  * **Open Technology:** using standard IDEs such as VSCode or PyCharm.  All of the key technology concepts you mastered above (Flask, SQLAlchemy) still fully apply.

This application was created using the API Logic Server CLI (Command Language Interface), with 1 command:

```bash
ApiLogicServer create --project_name=ApiLogicProject --db_url=nw-  # use Northwind, no customizations
```

Execute the Run Configuration **2. API Logic Server: Instant, Open**, and **Ports > Admin App > globe**

&nbsp;

<details markdown>

<summary> Show me how </summary>

&nbsp;

To run the ApiLogicProject app:

1. Click Run Configurations, select **2. API Logic Server: Instant, Open**, and click the green button to start the server

2. Click the **Ports** tab

3. Click the **globe** to start your Browser


<figure><img src="https://github.com/valhuber/apilogicserver/wiki/images/tutorial/2-apilogicproject.png?raw=true"></figure>

</details>

Things to note:

1. Note the API has been created, including swagger.  Explore it in the Browser.

2. You have in instant multi-page, multi-table admin app.

  * Don't spend much time exploring this app - we'll see a much more useful version in just a moment.

3. You can explore, and customize, the app in VSCode

4. It's a great start, but there are some serious short-comings:

  * **No security -** no login authentication

  * **No logic -** multi-table derivations and constraints for save logic

      * For example, open **Customers**, **double-click first Order**, and **delete the first Order**.  Re-click Customer from the left nav menu - it should have reduced the customer's balance from 2102, but it's unchanged.   That's because there is no logic... 

Let's see how these are addressed, in the next section.

<summary>3. Api Logic Project Logic: Unique Spreadsheet-like Rules -- 40X More Concise</summary>

&nbsp;

A running API and UI are a great start, but completing the project still requires logic and security.  This can be as much as half the effort, so we really haven't achieved "Low Code" until these are addressed.

A unique feature of API Logic Server is provision for:

* **Business Logic Automation:** using unique spreadsheet-like rules, extensible with Python üèÜ

* These are declared in your IDE, with full support for code completion, logging, and debugging

This application is a clone of the prior example, customized in VSCode:

* **API:** additional endpoints are defined in ```ApiLogicProject_Logic/api/customize_api.py```

* **Logic:**

  * **Rules** are declared in  ```ApiLogicProject_Logic/logic/declare_logic.py```

  * **Security** (multi-tenant support) is declared in ```ApiLogicProject_Logic/security/declare_security.py```

* **User Interface:** alterations are visible in ```ApiLogicProject/ui/admin/admin.yaml```

You can use VSCode to *diff* these from their originals in the *ApiLogicProject*.


You can run the app (same procedure as Step 2, above), and observe:

1. Click Category - you need to login now (user u1, password p).  That's because authentication has been activated.

2. Categories has fewer rows per multi-tenant Grants in ```ApiLogicProject_Logic/security/declare_security.py```

3. The app now shows help text to introduce its features 

4. Our Delete Order test works, since we how have logic in ```ApiLogicProject_Logic/logic/declare_logic.py```

Use the [```Detailed Tutorial```](ApiLogicProject/readme.md) to further explore this app.

<summary>Next Steps: new projects</summary>


As shown above, it's easy to create projects with a single command.  To help you explore, ApiLogicServer provides several prepackaged sqlite databases.  For example, create a project for this 1 table database:

```bash
cd tutorial
ApiLogicServer create --project_name=todo --db_url=todo
```
You can also try these other examples (be sure to `cd tutorial`; use the name below for both the _project_name_ and the _db_url_):

* **chinook** - albums and artists
* **classicmodels** - customers and orders

Launch configurations have been pre-created, then re-execute the Admin app as above.


> Next, try it on your own databases: if you have a database, you can have an API and an Admin app in minutes.
