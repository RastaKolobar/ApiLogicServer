Hi! 

I am the creator of API Logic Server, which creates Flask/SQLAlchemy projects from a database.  Open Source on git.  Recently, I came up with the notion of an "App Fiddle" - an online ability to fiddle with a complete app - full project, database - via the Browser.  See the link below.  

I see you are very active in the area of instruction, especially Flask/SQLAlchemy.  I am writing to see if you'd like to discuss how this might support your endeavors.  

Regards, Val
