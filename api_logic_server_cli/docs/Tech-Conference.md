# Description

## Title

  > Using API Logic Server for Web Applications - create with one command, customize in your IDE

## Description

API Logic Server is an open source Python system that creates __customizable database web app projects:__

* Creation is __Instant:__ create _executable_ projects from your database with a _single_ command.  Projects are __Highly Functional,__ providing:

    * __API:__ an endpoint for each table, with filtering, sorting, pagination and related data access

    * __Admin UI:__ multi-page / multi-table apps, with page navigations, automatic joins and declarative hide/show

* __Projects are Customizable, using _your IDE_:__ such as VSCode, PyCharm, etc, for familiar edit/debug services

* __Business Logic Automation:__ using unique spreadsheet-like rules, extensible with Python :trophy:

In this Tutorial, you will:

* create an application

* run it

* customize it using VSCode.

* learn about declarative, spreadsheet-like business logic for multi-table constraints and derivations

This talk will also give you a good intro to other technologies you may have already wanted to explore, with running code you can extend:

* SQLAlchemy - a popular Python ORM

* Flask - a web framework

* APIs - we'll explore two different styles of API (creator-defined, consumer-defined), and explore the latter using Swagger

* Codespaces - a GitHub product that provides cloud-based development with popular IDEs.

You will need a laptop with a Browser connection, and a GitHub account.  You do *not* need a Python install, a database, or an IDE... and if you *do* have these, they won't be affected.

## Audience

This tutorial is for developers interested in database systems, and the technologies above.  Required background:

* basic programming familiarity (e.g, understand program structure, event-oriented programming)

* some database background (you are good to go if you have a basic understanding of tables, columns and foreign keys)


## Outline

This will be a series of short lectures, and hands-on usage (watch and/or do):

* Introduction (15 min)

    * What is API Logic Server

    * Why we wrote it

* Starting Codespaces - you'll create a cloud-based development environment, and access it VSCode via your browser (5 min)

* Create a Project (10 min, Total 30 min)

* Run the Project; we'll explore (30 min, Total 1 hour)

    * the User Interface - a multi-page, multi-table application (underlying technology is React Admin)

    * the API - using Swagger to explore pagination, filtering etc

* Customize the Project - use VSCode to: (45 min, Total 1.75 hour)

    * Explore Project Structure

    * Add an Endpoint, and test it with the debugger

    * Customize the API

    * Explore logic - what it is, how to declare it, how it runs, and how to debug it

* Other Topics - explore on your own (time permitting - 15 min, Total 2 hours)

    * Testing with the Behave Framework

    * Schema Migrations with Alembic

# Additional Notes

Since API Logic Server is open source, you can obtain it

## Speaking Experience

I lead the PACE DBMS effort at Wang Labs, so gave many presentations for press briefings, User Conference Keynotes and working sessions, etc.

I was the CTO at Versata, so served as the lead technical presenter at User Groups at Conferences.
