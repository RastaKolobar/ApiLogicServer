## Install Python (if required)

To install Python:

* On Windows - run the windows installer - be sure to specify "add Python to Path"

* On Mac/Linux - your OS may provide installer options.
    
    * For example, Ubuntu provides the *Software Update* utility.  

    * Mac users can use the [standard installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/); follow the recommendations to install certificates and update your shell.

    > Installing Python on the Mac can be... _dramatic._  Consult the [Troubleshooting Guide](../Troubleshooting#python-issues).

    * Alternatively, many prefer [using homebrew](https://brew.sh/), as described [here](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac#what-to-do)
