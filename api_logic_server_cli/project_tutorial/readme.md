<summary>Approach: Learn By Example</summary>

Tutorials are useful ways to learn, but the __key concepts__ can be overshadowed by mechanics, and often don't include the real-world __IDE experience__.

Here we take a different approach: a __running app__ you can explore, using the table below:

* Explore code samples for key technology areas
* In a _running_ project
* That you can experiment with (debug, alter...)

To __explore code__, click the _Sample Code_ link - that will open that code file.

To __run__, use the Run/Debug configurations ("play" button, upper left).  There are 3 web apps you can run:


* Basic Flask - a __hand-coded__ web app with minimal functionality

* API Logic Server No Customizations - __automated__ by API Logic server.  Using the [Northwind Database](https://valhuber.github.io/ApiLogicServer/Sample-Database/), this illustrates what you can expect for an initial project using your own database

* API Logic Project - Customized, illustrating the use of a standard IDE to add code, and declarative logic and security

<summary>1. Basic Flask / SQLAlchemy</summary>

This illustrates a typical framework-based approach for creating projects - a minimal project for seeing core Flask and SQLAlchemy services in action.

Frameworks are flexible, and leverage your existing dev environment (IDE, git, etc).  But the manual effort is time-consuming, and complex.  This minimal project does not provide:

* an API endpoint for each table

* a User Interface

* any security, or business logic (multi-table derivations and constraints).

<summary>2. API Logic Server: automation, standard customization</summary>

&nbsp;

Instead of frameworks, we might employ a Low Code approach.  However, these often require extensive screen painting, and typically require a proprietary IDE.

The *API Logic Project No Customization* app provides an alternative, creating an entire project by reading your schema:

* **Faster** than Low Code, with instant APIs and Admin User Interfaces:

  * **API:** an endpoint for each table, with filtering, sorting, pagination and related data access

  * **Admin UI:** multi-page / multi-table apps, with page navigations, automatic joins and declarative hide/show.  It executes a yaml file, so basic customizations do not require HTML or JavaScript background.

      * Custom UIs can be built using your tool of choice (React, Angular, etc), using the API

* **Fully Extensible** using standard IDEs such as VSCode or PyCharm.  All of the key technology concepts you mastered above (Flask, SQLAlchemy) still fully apply.

<summary>3. Api Logic Server: Unique Declarative Logic and Security</summary>

&nbsp;

A running API and UI are a great start, but completing the project still requires logic and security.  This can be as much as half the effort, so we really haven't achieved "Low Code" until these are addressed.

A unique feature of API Logic Server is provision for:

* **Business Logic Automation:** using unique spreadsheet-like rules, extensible with Python üèÜ

* These are declared in your IDE, with full support for code completion, logging, and debugging
