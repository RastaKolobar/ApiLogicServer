# API Logic Server

There is widespread agreement that APIs are strategic
to the business, required for mobile apps and internal
/ external systems integration.

The problem is that they are time-consuming and costly to develop.
This reduces strategic business agility.

API Logic Server provides exceptional strategic business agility,
by creating an executable server for a database, instantly.

As illustrated below, the ```ApiLogicServer CLI``` (command line interface) creates an **API Logic Server,**
from your database.  An Api Logic Server consists of these features:


| Feature | Using   | Providing  |
| :-------------- |:--------------| :------| 
| 1. JSON:**API** and Swagger     | [SAFRS](https://github.com/thomaxxl/safrs/wiki) | APIs that clients can configure<br>to **reduce network traffic** |
| 2. Transactional **Logic**| [Logic Bank](https://github.com/valhuber/logicbank#readme) | *Spreadsheet-like Rules* are **40X more concise** <br>Compare Check Credit with [legacy code](https://github.com/valhuber/LogicBank/wiki/by-code)  |
| 3. Basic **Web App** | [Flask App Builder](https://flask-appbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), <br>[fab-quickstart](https://github.com/valhuber/fab-quick-start/wiki) | Instant **multi-page, multi-table** web app<br>for back-office admin, and prototyping |
 
This **declarative approach** is based on standard Python tooling,
and can be [installed](#Installation) and customized with standard approaches as described below.

### Tutorials
There are a number of facilities that will quickly enable you to get familiar with API Logic Server:
* [Tutorial](../../wiki/Tutorial) walks you through the steps of creating a server
* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVTdu6c0iSI) shows the steps of creating a server
* [Cloud Demo](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServerTutorial) enables you to run the demo using a cloud-based (MyBinder) install


# Quick Start - Create and Run
With a single command, create and run a
[logic](#logic)-enabled
[JSON:API](#api-safrs-jsonapi-and-swagger) and
[web app](#basic-web-app---flask-appbuilder) for your database:

<figure><img src="images/creates-and-runs.png"></figure>

As illustrated above, you run the ApiLogicServer CLI:
```
ApiLogicServer run        # note: you can also create (without execution)
```
> The ```db_url``` parameter defaults to a supplied [sample database](../../wiki/Sample-Database).
Specify a [SQLAlchemy url](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/engines.html)
to use your own database.


### Creates Project
The CLI introspects your database, and creates a project.  You can open
this in your IDE and customize it as described later.

### Runs Project

The CLI then starts the API. 
As illustrated aobve, the project implements:

1. Your ___API___, available in Swagger

2. With underlying ___logic___

3. And a ```basic_web_app```


### Customizable Project
Here is the 
[*customizable* ```api_server_project``` Project](../../wiki/ApiLogicServer-Guide);
you can open it in any IDE or Editor - here it is in PyCharm:

<figure><img src="images/customizable-project.png"></figure>

After customization, your ```api_logic_server``` project can be re-executed (without creating).
To run it:
1. Specify a proper ```venv``` (virtual environment)
   
   * The one used for ApiLogicServer install is fine, or you can use a project-specific
    [virtual environment](../../wiki/ApiLogicServer-Guide#environment)
    
2. Then:

```
python api_logic_server_run.py
python ui/basic_web_app/run.py
```


# Features

### API: SAFRS JSON:API and Swagger

Your API is instantly ready to support ui and integration
development, available in swagger:

<figure><img src="images/swagger.png"></figure>

> Customize your API by editing ```api/expose_services.py```, and see [Customizing](../../wiki/ApiLogicServer-Guide#customizing-apilogicprojects)

### Logic

Transactional business logic - multi-table derivations and
constraints - is a significant portion of database systems,
often nearly half.  Procedural coding is time-consuming
to develop and maintain, reducing business agility.

ApiLogicServer integrates Logic Bank, spreadsheet-like rules
that reduce transaction logic by 40X.
Logic is declared in Python (example below), and is:

- **Extensible:** logic consists of rules (see below), plus standard Python code

- **Multi-table:** rules like ``sum`` automate multi-table transactions

- **Scalable:** rules are pruned and optimized; for example, sums are processed as *1 row adjustment updates,* rather than expensive SQL aggregate queries

- **Manageable:** develop and debug your rules in IDEs, manage it in SCS systems (such as `git`) using existing procedures

The following 5 rules represent the
[same logic](https://github.com/valhuber/LogicBank/wiki/by-code)
as 200 lines of Python:
<figure><img src="https://github.com/valhuber/LogicBank/raw/main/images/example.png"></figure>

> Declare your logic by editing: **```logic/logic_bank.py```**


### Basic Web App - Flask Appbuilder

UI development takes time.  That's a problem since
* Such effort may not be warranted for admin "back office" screens,
and
  
* [Agile approaches](https://agilemanifesto.org) depend on getting _working
software_ soon, to drive _collaboration and iteration_.

ApiLogicServer CLI therefore creates working software _now:_
multi-page, multi-table applications as shown below:

1. **Multi-page:** apps include 1 page per table

2. **Multi-table:** pages include ``related_views`` for each related child table, and join in parent data

3. **Favorite fields first:** first-displayed field is "name", or `contains` "name" (configurable)

4. **Predictive joins:** favorite field of each parent is shown (product *name* - not product *id*)

5. **Ids last:** such boring fields are not shown on lists, and at the end on other pages

<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valhuber/fab-quick-start/master/images/generated-page.png"></figure>

> Customize your app by editing: **```ui/basic_web_app/app/views.py```**

> Before running, [some setup is required](../../wiki/Working-with-Flask-AppBuilder) for Flask App Builder (except for Northwind, which is pre-created).


# Installation
Caution: Python install is rather more than running an installer.
Use this page to [Verify / Install Python](../../wiki/Python-Verify-and-Install).

Then, install the ApiLogicServer CLI in the usual manner:

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # windows venv\Scripts\activate
pip install ApiLogicServer
```

# Learning
Take the [tutorial](../../wiki/Tutorial) to run your locally installed software.

If you'd like to try it with no install on the Cloud, use [this version of the Tutorial](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServerTutorial#readme).

# Project Information

### Status: Alpha

Initially released 1/19/2021, the project has stabilized:

* The [default Northwind project](../../wiki/Sample-Database) is working with for both the API and the web app,
  with pre-created logic (good to explore for examples)
  

*   We have tested several sqlite databases, and several MySQL databases -
    see [status here.](../../wiki/Testing)
    These are successfully creating / executing the API and the web app.

We are tracking [issues in git](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/issues).
