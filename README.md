# Welcome to API Logic Server

API Logic Server creates __customizable database web app projects:__

* __Creation is Instant:__ create projects with a single command

* __Projects are Highly Functional:__

    * __API:__ an endpoint for each table, with filtering, sorting, pagination and related data access

    * __Admin UI:__ multi-page / multi-table apps, with page navigations and automatic joins

* __Projects are Customizable, using _your IDE_:__ such as VSCode, PyCharm, etc, for familiar edit/debug services

* __Business Logic Automation:__ using unique rules, extensible with Python


&nbsp;

# Background
A brief look at why we built it, and what it is.<br><br>

### Motivation - not instant, propietary IDE, no logic automation

We looked at approaches for building database systems:   

* __Frameworks:__ Frameworks like Flask or Django enable you to build a single endpoint or _Hello World_ page, but a __multi-endpoint__ API and __multi-page__ application would take __weeks__ or more.

* __Low Code Tools:__ these are great for building great UIs, but

    * Want a multi-page app -- __no screen painting__
    * Want to __preserve dev tools__ - VSCode, PyCharm, git, etc
    * Need an answer for __backend logic__ (it's nearly half the effort)<br><br>


### Our Approach: Instant, Customizable, Logic Automation

API Logic Server is an open source Python project, consisting of:

* a set of runtimes (SAFRS API, Flask, SQLAlchemy ORM, rule engine) for project execution, plus 

* a CLI (Command Language Interface) to create executable projects, which can be customized in an IDE such as VSCode or PyCharm

It runs as a standard pip install, or under Docker. After installation, you use the CLI create a project like this:

```
ApiLogicServer create --project_name=ApiLogicProject db_url=
```

> API Logic Server reads your schema, and creates an executable, customizable project providing the features listed below.  Check it out - __zero install__ - [here, in Codespaces](https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/ApiLogicProject#readme).

# Instant -- Single Command

Use the CLI to create the sample API and Admin App project, with a single command.

&nbsp;

### Create With Docker

Execute the following commands (Windows, use Powershell):

```bash title="Run API Logic Server in Docker"
# Start the API Logic Server docker container
docker run -it --name api_logic_server --rm -p 5656:5656 -p 5002:5002 -v ${PWD}:/localhost apilogicserver/api_logic_server

ApiLogicServer create-and-run --project_name=/localhost/ApiLogicProject --db_url=
```
&nbsp;

### Or, Create With Local Install
Presuming Python 3.7+ [is installed](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Install/), it's typically:

```bash title="Run API Logic Server from a local pip install"
python -m venv venv                  # may require python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate             # windows venv\Scripts\activate
venv\Scripts\activate                # mac/linux: source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install ApiLogicServer

ApiLogicServer create-and-run        # create, or create-and-run; accept defaults
```
&nbsp;

## Execute

Your server is running - explore the data and api at [localhost:5656](http://localhost:5656).  Using the defaults provided above, you have started the [Tutorial](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Tutorial), the recommended quick start for API Logic Server.

&nbsp;

# Customize in IDE

VSCode and PyCharm users can customize and run/debug within their IDE with [these steps](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/IDE-Execute/).  Created projects include Launch and Docker configurations.  

<figure><img src="https://github.com/valhuber/apilogicserver/wiki/images/generated-project.png?raw=true"></figure>

[Rebuild services](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Project-Rebuild/) are provided to accomodate changes to database structure or ORM classes.

&nbsp;

# Overview Video

Project creation is based on database schema introspection as shown below: identify a database, and the ```ApiLogicServer create``` commands creates an executable, customomizable project.

Click for a video tutorial, showing complete project creation, execution, customization and debugging.

&nbsp;

# Getting Started

### Quick Evaluation - _no install_

You can avoid install hassles by exploring the [Sample Project in Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=593459232).  This will enable you to use VSCode - _in your Browser, zero install_ - to:

* see the created project
* use the Tutorial to run, customize and debug it 

We think you'll find Codespaces pretty amazing - check it out!

### Local Install

API Logic Server is designed to make it easy to get started:

* **Install and run Tutorial** - 
[install](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Install-Express/), and explore the [tutorial](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Tutorial/).  You'll create a complete project using the pre-installed sample database, explore its features, and support for customization and debugging. 

* **Dockerized Test Databases** - 
then, you might like to try out some of our [dockerized test databases](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Database-Connectivity/).

* **Your Database** - 
finally, try your own database.

&nbsp;

# Project Information

### Tutorials
