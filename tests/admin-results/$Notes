Testing Notes:
    * Val has altered
        * menu.js - hello screen, links to swagger and docs
        * config.js
            * loads admin.yaml from disk
                * if missing, uses config.json import (as as to run without LAC)
            * converts admin-attributes (if present) to admin-column for internal admin app use
                * Detects and does not convert admin-column; this enables testing of load vs conversion

This directory contains various yaml files, and their json equivalents, for test compares.

Update 11/23 - parent joins, child grids running
    * running with admin-attr, admin-col

Proposed Release criteria (Val)
* Technology Preview - public pip/docker release, low key (Legend: + working, - todo, ? needs discussion)
    + Works from ApiLogicServer run, all browsers
    + Admin-attributes, loaded from created project (many properties may be ignored)
    + Admin page has link to swagger
    + Works in VSCode (the missing menu can be a doc'd bug if fix is not easy / obvious)
    + Joins - parent & child, any sensible default
    - Filter (might be working, haven't tried)
    * All pages work for test DBs
* Announcement (articles, videos etc)
    - Lookups!!
    - Add order - cascade add (set OrderDetail.OrderId from Order), lookup OrderDetail.Product
    - Constraint retry (show message, stay on page, retry or cancel)
    * PythonAnywhere demo (combined app/api)
    ? Image? Link? Money?  Date?
    - Notes (for demo self-discovery)
    - Join attrs - explicit from admin (so avoid redundant master)
* Key Futures
    * Hide / Show
    * Set attr=value, save (e.g., checkout, approve, etc)
