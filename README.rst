API Logic Server
================

Creates an executable API from a database:

- **API:** `swagger/OpenAPI <https://swagger.io/>`_ and `JSON:API <jsonapi.org>`_ compliant.  Uses `SAFRS <https://pypi.org/project/safrs/>`_ , a modern approach that enables client applications to configure their own API to reduce network traffic.

- **Web App:** a multi-page, multi-table web app; incorporates `fab-quickstart <https://pypi.org/project/fab-quick-start/>`_

- **Logic:** spreadsheet-like rules for multi-table derivations and constraint that reduce transaction logic by 40X, using `Logic Bank <https://pypi.org/project/logicbank//>`



Installation
------------

Logic is declared in Python (example below), and is:

- **Extensible:** logic consists of rules (see below), plus standard Python code

- **Multi-table:** rules like ``sum`` automate multi-table transactions

- **Scalable:** rules are pruned and optimized; for example, sums are processed as *1 row adjustment updates,* rather than expensive SQL aggregate queries

- **Manageable:** develop and debug your rules in IDEs, manage it in SCS systems (such as `git`) using existing procedures


API: SAFRS JSON:API and Swagger
-------------------------------
The following 5 rules represent the same logic as 200 lines
of Python:

Basic Web App - Flask Appbuilder
--------------------------------
Generated fab pages look as shown below:

#. **Multi-page:** apps include 1 page per table

#. **Multi-table:** pages include ``related_views`` for each related child table, and join in parent data

#. **Favorite field first:** first-displayed field is "name", or `contains` "name" (configurable)

#. **Predictive joins:** favorite field of each parent is shown (product *name* - not product *id*)

#. **Ids last:** such boring fields are not shown on lists, and at the end on other pages
